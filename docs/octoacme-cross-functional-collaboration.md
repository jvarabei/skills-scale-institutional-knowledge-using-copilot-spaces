## Collaboration Best Practices

### Clear Communication
- **Be explicit about expectations**: Don't assume others know what you need
- **Use the right channel**: Urgent = Slack mention, FYI = async
- **Close the loop**: Confirm you received and understood information
- **Document decisions**: Record key decisions and their rationale

### Proactive Engagement
- **Don't wait to be asked**: Share information proactively
- **Raise blockers early**: Don't wait until they're critical
- **Invite relevant stakeholders**: Better to over-include than miss someone
- **Share work in progress**: Get feedback early, not at the end

### Respect & Trust
- **Assume good intent**: Give colleagues the benefit of the doubt
- **Respect expertise**: Trust specialists in their domain
- **Ask questions**: Curiosity is a strength, not a weakness
- **Give credit**: Acknowledge others' contributions

### Efficient Meetings
- **Have an agenda**: Share objectives and topics in advance
- **Start and end on time**: Respect everyone's schedule
- **Assign action items**: Clear owner and due date
- **Share notes**: Document decisions and next steps
- **Question whether a meeting is needed**: Consider async alternatives

## Common Cross-Functional Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Design Changes During Development

**Challenge**: UX Designer realizes design needs adjustment after development started.

**Collaboration Pattern:**
1. UX Designer alerts Scrum Master and PM immediately
2. UX Designer meets with Developers to discuss options and impact
3. Product Manager makes prioritization call (include now vs. next sprint)
4. Scrum Master adjusts sprint plan if change is included
5. Technical Writer is notified of any terminology changes

**Key Success Factor**: Early escalation and collaborative problem-solving

---

### Scenario 2: Customer-Reported Bug Needs Urgent Fix

**Challenge**: Support escalates critical customer bug mid-sprint.

**Collaboration Pattern:**
1. Support files detailed bug report with reproduction steps
2. Developers investigate and estimate fix effort
3. Product Manager and Scrum Master prioritize against sprint goals
4. If urgent: Developers fix, Technical Writer updates docs, Support tests
5. Project Manager communicates timeline to Sales and customer

**Key Success Factor**: Clear escalation path and rapid triage

---

### Scenario 3: Compliance Review Finds Issues Late

**Challenge**: Compliance team identifies concerns during pre-release review.

**Collaboration Pattern:**
1. Compliance clearly documents issues and requirements
2. Project Manager calls emergency review with PM, Developers, UX
3. Developers estimate fix effort, PM assesses impact on release date
4. Team decides: fix now (delay release) or fix next sprint
5. Project Manager communicates decision and timeline to stakeholders

**Key Success Factor**: Early compliance engagement in planning phase

---

### Scenario 4: Sales Requests Feature Demo for Big Deal

**Challenge**: Sales needs feature demo but feature isn't fully ready.

**Collaboration Pattern:**
1. Sales requests demo with context (customer, timeline, deal size)
2. Product Manager assesses feature readiness and risk
3. If appropriate: UX Designer and Developer prepare demo environment
4. Technical Writer provides draft documentation for demo
5. Product Manager or UX Designer delivers demo with Sales
6. Sales provides feedback to Product Manager

**Key Success Factor**: Clear criteria for when to demo incomplete features

## Collaboration Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Siloed work**: Working in isolation and surprising team with deliverables  
✅ **Collaborative iteration**: Sharing work in progress and getting feedback early

❌ **Over-the-wall handoffs**: Tossing work to next person without context  
✅ **Paired transition**: Working together during handoffs to share context

❌ **Meeting overload**: Scheduling meetings for everything  
✅ **Async-first mindset**: Default to async communication, meet when needed

❌ **Passive-aggressive Slack**: Vague complaints in public channels  
✅ **Direct communication**: Address issues directly with relevant people

❌ **Hoarding information**: Keeping knowledge in your head  
✅ **Documentation culture**: Writing things down for others to discover

---

## Tools for Collaboration

- **Synchronous**: Zoom/Teams, Slack huddles, in-person meetings
- **Asynchronous**: Slack messages, email, GitHub discussions, documentation
- **Shared context**: Project boards, design files, shared documents
- **Status visibility**: Dashboards, automated reports, project boards
- **Decision tracking**: Decision logs, RFCs, architecture docs

**Choose the right tool for the type of collaboration needed.**

---

## Continuous Improvement

Teams should regularly review their collaboration patterns:
- Discuss what's working and what's not in retrospectives
- Adjust meeting cadence based on team needs
- Experiment with new collaboration tools and practices
- Share successful patterns with other teams
- Update this guide based on learnings

**Good collaboration is a skill teams build over time, not a one-time setup.**
